👋 Hello, I am a Ph.D. ABD under the supervision of [Dr. Andrew Crooks](https://www.gisagents.org/) in the [Department of Geography](http://www.buffalo.edu/cas/geography.html) at the [University at Buffalo](http://www.buffalo.edu/). My research focuses on critically understanding urban space by leveraging (geo)computational techniques and data informatics. I am interested in *Urban Data Science, Geocomputation, Non-visual sensory measuring & monitoring, Spatial analysis & visualization and Social media & big data*. 

🌐 My academic journey is fortified by a M.S. in Physics from the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) and a B.S. from Minjiang University.

🔭 Prior to starting my Ph.D., I honed my research acumen as a Research Associate at the [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/) and as a Research Engineer at the [Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology](https://smart.mit.edu/) Centre.
